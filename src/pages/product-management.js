            <p>
              We like to start off every new project with a team that's firmly aligned and prepared to develop what the client needs. We start off by collecting requirements an learning how your business operates so we can and align with your goals. By the end of the project kickoff we should have a backlog of tasks roughly estimated and an idea of what we should have built at various stages throughout develpoment. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of the kickoff is primary to align all team members on these goals, itentify risks or contrainsts that can be mitigated against, establish keys deliverables of the project.

            <p>
              After a project has kciked off, an Evaluates2 project manager will follow relatively stardard agile methodologies to manage the project such as daily standup meetings, IPMs, demos, and retros.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our project managers are flexible enough to use project management software that your team prefers. For user story tracking we typically use Jira, Pivotal Tracker, Clubhouse, Monday, or Trello. Trello is comes with a low price and learning curve while Jira is more suitable for larger enterprise clients, and the others are somewhere in between. We believe the simple, frictionless communication is critical so we use Slack for text communication and Google hangouts or Skype for remote meetings.
            </p>
            {/* <p>
              Once a project is kicked off, Def Method PMs use an agile process to
              manage product development. This includes daily standups, weekly
              IPMs, weekly demos and project retros.
          </p>
            <p>
              The PMs will work with the project management tools that your team
              prefers. For user story tracking we commonly use Pivotal Tracker,
              Trello, or Jira. Pivotal Tracker and Trello come with a low learning
              curve and are straightforward to set up, whereas Jira allows for
              detailed customization of workflow and is well suited to larger
              scale projects. We typically use Slack for communication, Google
              Hangouts/Meet for remote meetings, Rollbar for error tracking and
              New Relic for performance monitoring.

              temporarily from active development of new features to ongoing

              At Evaluates2 we pride ourselves on being able to finish development of a project quickly and with very few bugs. However, any software will need some upkeep and monitoring, and we set out from the beginning to make maintenace of our applications as easy and streamlined as possible.

              {/* As part of our development process, we will implement the
              appropriate tracking tools to ensure your application is effectively
              maintained. This includes error tracking and performance monitoring
              tools with appropriate notification settings and user tracking tools
              such as Google Analytics, Mix Panel or Heap. At Def Method we stand
              behind the products we build and will support you if your product
              goes down. We offer maintenance plans for customers that are
              interested in having the option for development of small features
              and bug resolution. */}

              As part of the development process we will implement the appropriate logging and monitoring tools. We also create detailed documentation and provide training to engineers responsible for maintenace during project handoff sessions. Although we primarily aim to develop a project and let the client take over, we can provide Evaluates2 engineerings on standby for ongoing maintenance and/or bugfixes if desired.

Once we have defined each user story, we add functional and non-functional requirements and acceptance criteria that need to be met for the user story to be considered completed. We break down our user stories to make sure each user story is small enough to be done within 2-3 days to ensure ongoing progress and prevent blockers."

As soon as a user story is complete it is put in a queue for you to review and approve. To facilitate the review and feedback process we hold weekly demos of the delivered features with the engineers. This is where you provide feedback to the team on what you see. The ongoing nature of the review and feedback process throughout development allows you to call in adjustments as the work is being done reducing significant rework and redesign. It also provides full transparency to you with regard to the progress and quality of work being conducted."

While making changes to the code they are simultaneously talking out loud about what they are thinking.

In this way two developers understand the code even before any reviews of pull requests."

That's ok as long as it's a rare occurence and the blocker is communicated as soon as it is discovered during stand-up meetings. In general, we prefer demo meetings that are over more like festive celebrations with catering and live usable devices available.
