    <h1>Stage 1</h1>
    <h1>The Discovery Process</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Evaluates2 Discovery Process is an amalgamation of a Design Sprint as
      described by Jake Knapp from Google Ventures in the book Sprint
      (http://www.gv.com/sprint/) and an agile product inception as described by
      Martin Fowler in his Lead Inception article
      (https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/). During this workshop
      the team will focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>- Project goals and key risks</li>
      <li>- Assumptions</li>
      <li>- Storyboarding and solution mapping</li>
      <li>- Feature prioritization</li>
      <li>- Creative problem solving</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      The goal of the Discovery Process is to deliver the information your
      company needs to make immediate progress on the most important features of
      the platform. You will walk away from this workshop with a team that is
      firmly aligned and a product plan that is clear and tested.
    </p>
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>Stage 2</h1>
    <h1>MVP Development</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of the Product Discovery process is to achieve
      successful application development and delivery. Using the deliverables
      from the Discovery Workshop, Evaluates2 will begin the development process
      following the Product Discovery.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>- Offshore resources available </li>
      <li>- Product Management </li>
      <li>- Product Strategy </li>
      <li>- User Testing</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>Stage 3</h1>
    <h1>Maintenance</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      As is a natural course for many websites, startups will typically
      temporarily move from active development of new features on its website to
      ongoing maintenance after the launch of the MVP. With maintenance you can
      rest assured that your application will stay up and running with a
      part-time engineer keeping your code base up-to-date and smaller features
      built. During maintenance mode you will get the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>- Implementation of small user features</li>
      <li>- Update and maintenance of 3rd party dependencies</li>
      <li>- Resolution of bugs</li>
      <li>
        - Monitoring for exceptions, unusual traffic patterns, performance
        degradation, or increased memory usage
      </li>
      <li>
        - Infrastructural and architectural maintenance (AWS, Heroku, etc...)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
