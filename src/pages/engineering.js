    Ways we can work together
...to get your product built

<h1>
      Technical Audits
  </h1>
    During the technical audit an Evaluates2 engineer will work with you to answer any technical questions you may have. For example they can focus on an assessment of the health of your current code base, work on estimating time & cost for new features you are looking to build, and they can offer general technical guidance for your technical decisions. Also, it's free! ðŸ˜Š
    
<h1>
      StaffAugmentation
  </h1>
    Our NYC-based engineers will work on site with your team. By having our engineers in the office, you can experience information osmosis. In general working this way means that development can be more productive and the engineers can better understand the industry and overall company goals. Also, your team will benefit more from working with our engineers day-to-day, sharing knowledge with your team, build lasting relationships with junior and senior team members alike.
<h1>
      Resource Efficiency
</h1>
    We teach through example. When you work with Evaluates2 engineers they not only will move your product forward, but they will also work with your team to make strides with overall resource efficiency. This can be done through pair programming, implementation of agile process such as daily standups, or overall engineer management.
