If they fail, all developers are notified immediately so that a fix can be made. If all tests pass, the continuous delivery system will deploy these new changes directly to the staging environment. Evaluates2 maintains two environments when building applications: a staging and a production environment. Production is what you might expect: itâ€™s the live site, the public-facing application that everyone uses on a daily basis. The staging environment is not open to the public. Our customer and Evaluates2 engineers are the only ones who can see the staging environment. With a staging environment, stakeholders can see our progress, evaluate features, and experiment without worrying about impacting real users.

These tests run continuously to ensure proper functionality and to reduce the presence of bugs. In our opinion, testing is paramount for the future success of your project.
