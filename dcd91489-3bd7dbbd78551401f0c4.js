board for years, somehow rose above and evolved to become king of the web. Its interpreted, dynamically-typed nature makes for very concise code, and it supports both class-based OOP and extremely functional coding styles. Virtually EVERY website and web application on the web today is written in or compiles down to JavaScript. Node.js is often our go-to choice both for simple lambda functions and complex backend servers. The ability to have one consistent language across front-end and back-end makes JavaScript an incredibly popular choice.",TypeScript:'Ohhh TypeScript... take all the things you like about JavaScript and add the ability to explicitly define interfaces, create enums, overload functions, etc. TypeScript gives developers syntactic sugar that "should" make your code easier to write, read, and understand. TypeScript sometimes gets a bad rap for causing annoying little errors and even sometimes slowing development in the short run, but after working with Evaluates2 engineers on a project with it we believe everyone can learn to love TypeScript!',"Clojure / ClojureScript":"Clojure is a dialect of lisp, and it aims to frame programming as a logical evaluation of functions and immutable data. It was created by Rich Hickey as a way to run Lisp on the JVM (first released in 2007). The syntax is meant to be extremely terse and clear as to allow programmers to get things done correctly, quickly, and enjoyably. A version that targets the Node.js V8 runtime, referred to as ClojureScript, appeared later as a response to the growing reach of JavaScript. Today, ClojureScript can be used on the back-end or front-end, allowing savvy Clojurists to build virtually anything they could make in JavaScript or Java with Clojure syntax instead. Here at Evaluates2 we appreciate the beauty and brevity of Clojure code, and we love building projects using this awesome language!","Go Lang":"Go is an incredibly run-time efficient, statically-typed language that is great for server-side development. It is compiled directly to machine code and was created within Google in 2007 to improve developer productivity by replacing C++ code with something syntactically cleaner. When coding in Go you get a ton of power without all the hoopla, allowing programmers to quickly write code that is simple, efficient, and correct.",Rust:"Rust is an extremely fast, static typed language that emphasizes safe memory management. Created in 2006 within Mozilla to more easily develop safe systems, Rust has emerged as a very interesting, syntactically powerful language that compiles to machine code which can run at, near, and even is some cases better than the speed of equivalent code written in C or C++. Rust's actix framework often wins speed benchmarks for server-side code, and it's quickly becoming the language of choice for web assembly (WASM) front-end projects.",Swift:"Swift is a elegant and fast modern language. It is open source and was created by Apple in 2014 as a replacement for Objective-C. It's strict syntax encourages you to write clean and consistent code. While everyone knows it is THE language for native iOS development, it also has excellent performance as a server-side language.",Kotlin:"Kotlin is a syntatically beautiful, modern alternative to Java that targets JVM, JavaScript, Android, and other native platforms. It was developed by Jetbrains, officially released v1.0 in February 2016, and it is free & open-source. Kotlin is a great language to work with from the developer's perspective which is why we love building android apps and serverless functions in Kotlin!",Python:"Python, originally developed in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language, has evolved considerably since then including majors upgrades Python 2 in 2000 and Python 3 in 2008. It is a now a general-purpose dynamic, garbage-collected language that is great for data science, machine-learning algorithms, staticial work, and general backend APIs.",Scala:"Scala is meant to be an extremely flexible alternative to Java that is both object-oriented and functional and runs on the JVM. It was created in 2004 by Martin Odersky and it a fantastic server-side language.",Haskell:"Haskell is a purely functional, statically-typed language. Developed by academic professors, it was first released in 2003 and used largely only in academia. However, we have successfully used Haskell for AWS Lambda functions, in analytics work, and other areas. If your engineering team has an interest in Haskell, we'd love to help build out test-driven Haskell services and applications.",Java:"Java, released in 1995, was very popular langague at the turn of the century and still is today. Its object-oriented principles and straightforward yet sometimes overly-verbose syntax has been enjoyed by many developers over the years. Although its popularity has declined, new versions of Java are still being released in an attempt to compete with newer langauges that claim to have a cleaner and more succinct syntax. The JVM runtime is extremely fast for certain tasks and is still a great choice for many software projects today.","C#":"C# was initially meant to be a general purpose C-like object-oriented programming language for the .NET framework. It was created within Microsoft and appeared in the year 2000. Although windows forms UI has fallen somewhat out of style, C# is still a popular and fine choice for server-side development.",Ruby:"Ruby is a language that was developed for programmer productivity with the idea that coding should be fun for programmers. It was developed in Japan in the mid 1990s and is still a popular choice for building quick prototypes and as a general purpose programming language.","C / C++":"If you need to squeeze out every possible last ounce of juice from your server, C and/or C++ will give you the absolute most control. Although it isn't the most concise and readable code, C has been running in production since its origins in the early 1970s, and raw C indeed has withstood the test of time to establish itself as a valid consideration as a language even for new projects today."},A={"CI & Multiple Environments":{header:"The Use of Continuous Integration and Multiple Environments",paragraph1:"Each time an engineer makes a substantial change he or she will commit this change to GitHub (or the repository hosting service of your choice). Here at Evaluates2 we prefer to employ automated continuous delivery processes whereby any changes in GitHub (to specially designated branches) are detected at which point all builds are done, various automated tests are run, etc. If any step fails, all developers are notified immediately so that a fix can be made. After all commands exit successfully the continuous delivery system will then deploy these new changes directly to the staging environment.",paragraph2:'Here at Evaluates2 we prefer to maintain three environments when building applications: development, staging, and production. Development is connected to automated continuous deployment and should be rapidly changing. Staging is the "pre-release" environment where we a human can give a final check over of things before pushing to prod. Production is the live user-facing application environment! Code will finally be deployed here if all automted tests are passing and a QA engineer has given the "ok" for the new features / bugfixes in staging environment.'},"Test Driven Development":{header:"The Importance of Test Driven Development (TDD)",paragraph1:'Here at Evaluate2 we have several core values that we insist on when working with a client, and one of those core values is the use of test-driven development. Test Driven Development, or "TDD" for short, is a software development process that builds up a suite of automated tests alongside the software source code. These tests run continuously to quickly ensure proper functionality and to reduce the presence of bugs.',paragraph2:"In our opinion, testing is paramount for the future success of your project, and your future success is our main priority. By working in small red-green-refactor cycles we can be confident that our tests are passing only when they should be passing, and depending on the project we utilize a wide variety of automated tests including unit testing, end-to-end testing, UI testing, Behavior-driven testing, load testing, and smoke testing. We also prefer to take an outside-in approach where we begin with cucumber bdd tests whose step definition are mapped to UI tests (or end-to-end tests calling our routes for beckend REST server projects). We then try to make these tests pass by writing the implementation code with unit tests in a TDD fashion."},"Healthy Dependencies":{header:"Keeping a Project Robust & Fresh",paragraph1:"Third-party libraries are great to use, but there are a few considerations that must be carefully considered. Our engineers can help guide decision making in library selection and provide support for upgrading old libraries to newer versions.",paragraph2:"After years of development most large project will have significat amounts of technical tebt. Maybe the engineers just couldn't get those automated tests to work so they abandoned the pracice, or maybe the project works but there are tons of annoying warnings in the console.
